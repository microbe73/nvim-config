# nvim-config
This is my neovim configuration it's on github if I ever need to move it to another computer

It started from the modular kickstart repository, some added stuff includes vimtex, coqtail, and neorg and other stuff
I'm not really keeping track of what I added I just add things when I find them useful and it works quite well so far
